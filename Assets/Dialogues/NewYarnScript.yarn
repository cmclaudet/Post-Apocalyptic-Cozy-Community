title: Start

The end of the world was rather unspectacular. 

It started slowly - temperature and sea levels rising, but we had it under control. It wasn‘t that bad - longer summers, colder winters - we got used to it, some even enjoyed it.

Natural disasters started occuring more frequently, but there was time to rebuild, recover, get back to normal. 

Until there wasn‘t.

Hurricanes, blizzards, earthquakes – everything happened everywhere at at once. In some places, the air became unbreathable. 

We jumped into action then, tried to clean up what we could, protect ourselves. But it was too late. 

The moment even the last deniers realized we wouldn't return to normal was when the billionaires disappeared. But we had other things to worry about by then. 

And so we huddled together in shelters, bunkers and caves, waiting for the disaster to pass or to die.

So this is how it went down. Not with a bang, but a whimper. 

But this is not the story of how everything ended.

It‘s the story of what we did after.

NOW

It‘s been a while since the last storm had passed. Food has been getting sparse, and our shelters can no longer provide us with everything we needed. 

So one by one, we've started to go out into the world - to explore, to survive, find a new place to call home. 

We wandered until we found a small valley with clean air and a source of water. 

Of course, a place like this is bound to attract all kinds of people.

That's how we met.

Lance: This seems like a nice enough place to stay.
Stella: Yes! I love the energy here. 
Abuela: But there's nowhere to sleep! We have to set up a shelter.
Lance: We don't have enough building material for that. 
Lance: We'll need at least some wood to set up something rudimentary.
Stella: I sense the presence of a forest nearby. I can go gather some.
Abuela: All by yourself? That's dangerous, mija!
Lance: Let's send two people to look for wood. The remaining person can watch the campfire.

SCENE - FOREST

Lance: We actually reached a forest!
Stella: You sound surprised. Didn't I tell you it was here?
Lence: Well, you said you "sensed the forest's presence." Pardon me if I don't view that as the most reliable form of directions.
Stella: You should have a little more trust, Lance. 
Stella: Mother Nature speaks to us. She can guide us wherever we need to go.
Lance: Well, Mother Nature also obliberated Birmingham, so I might have some trust issues there.
Lance: Anyway, back to the task at hand. We need some sturdy wood.
Lance: If we had an axe, we could just cut it from the trees. But without tools, we'll have to look for big fallen branches.
Stella: This is the perfect opportunity to open your mind. Let Mother Nature guide us to find wood.
Lance: Or we could just look for it on the ground, like normal people.

Stella: Close your eyes and listen to her voice.
Lance: Hmm. I do feel a strange urge to turn this way…
Stella: Look! Over there – those branches are usable, right?
Lance: They're perfect! 
Lance: I hate to admit it, but it seems Mother Nature has led us to success.

Abuela: Welcome back! Did you find any wood?
Stella: Of course. There's nothing you can't achieve with an open mind and spirit.
Lance: I would argue with that, but we're doing things Stella's way today.
Abuela: How nice. I made some soup for everyone. After we've eaten, we can set up the shelter!

Lance: There are plenty of branches over here.
Stella: Hmm, they look quite brittle to me.
Lance: No, they're –

Abuela: Welcome back! Did you find any wood?
Lance: Don't ask.
Stella: We would have been fine, if Lance had been open to Mother Nature's voice.
Lance: It's not my fault there weren't any decent branches in that damn forest!
Abuela: Don't fight. We'll just have to try again.
Abuela: But maybe we should try a different combination of people this time…

SCENE - FOREST

Stella: Here we are in the forest, just like I sensed.
Abuela: Impressive, mija. You are well-attuned to nature.
Stella: I just listen to Mother Nature's voice.
Stella: And look, there are some sturdy branches! Let's collect them.
Abuela: Not so many!
Abuela: Women shouldn't carry so much. We are too delicate.
Stella: That's a limiting belief, abuela. I am a lot stronger than you think.
Stella: And we'll need a lot of wood if we want to construct a decent shelter.

SCENE - ROAD

Abuela: Which way could this forest be?
Lance: We don't even know that there is one. Stella only said she "sensed" one.
Abuela: This is a rural area. Walk long enough, and we'll have to find a forest eventually.
Abuela: I think I hear birdsong from the left path. Let's go this way.
Lance: I don't know. My gut is telling me to go right.

Abuela: Yes, mija. We just had to follow the sound of the birds.
Stella: How wonderful! They are Mother Nature's minstrels.
Lance: Err, sure. More importantly, though, we gathered all the wood that we need.
Stella: Wonderful. I made seed porridge while you were gone. After we've eaten, we can set up the shelter!

Abuela: We've been walking along this road for quite a while. 
Lance: I'm sure we'll hit the forest soon.
Abuela: Really? Because I think we've seen that rock over there before.
Abuela: Are we walking in circles?
Lance: What? No! Um … maybe.
Abuela: We should go back to the camp. Stella will know the way.

Stella: We can try again. But this time, maybe I should come with you…

Abuela: How do we build a shelter? I've never constructed anything in my life.
Stella: Oh, how hard can it be?
Lance: Err, it's not quite that easy.
Lance: But luckily, I know a thing or two about carpentry.
Abuela: Oh, que suerte! I though you were an accountant. Where did you learn that?
Lance: My ex-husband and I bought a house. It was a bit of a fixer-upper.
Lance: We poured our heart and soul into the renovation. It turned out quite nice, if I do say so myself.
Lance: Of course, there's not much left of it now.
Stella: Well then, let's set up this shelter!
Abuela: We're almost out of food, though. One of us should look for nuts and mushrooms, or we'll go hungry tomorrow.

Lance: All right, first thing we need to do is tie these branches together in a V shape.
Stella: Can't we just cover the branches with clay?
Stella: I once volunteered on a farm where we made clay with horse manure and-
Lance: Stella, I appreciate your… creative approach to problem solving.
Lance: But this will go a lot faster if you just trust me here.
Stella: ...

Abuela: I'm not sure I will be much help in this. I'm not very strong.
Lance: Don't worry. If you just hand me that rope, and we'll tie the branches together like so.
Abuela: Amazing! I'm learning so much today.
Abuela: You remind me of my nephew, Diego. He's talented with these things, too. He once built me a rocking chair ...
Abuela: He also likes los hombres. And did I mention he's very handsome?
Lance: Abuela, are you trying to set me up with your nephew?
Abuela: Mijo. All I'm saying is that if Diego ever finds his way to our camp, you two will get along very well.
Lance: Good to know. Let's get back to building the shelter, shall we?

Abuela: I don't know if it was a good idea to do this without Lance.
Abuela: He seemed to know what he's talking about.
Stella: I'm sure we can figure it out without him.
Stella: Maybe we can the branches stick together with clay?
Stella: I once volunteered on a farm where we made clay with horse manure.
Abuela: No caballos here, mija.
Stella: Well, we can just mix some soil with water to make mud.
Abuela: If you think so ...
Stella: Oh no! This isn't sticking a all.
Abuela: All we've made is a mess.
Abuela: Let's start again. But this time, we should really ask Lance to help.
