It‘s been a while since the last storms passed. Food has been getting sparse, and the shelters overcrowded.

So one by one, we started to go out into the world - to explore, to survive, maybe even a new home. 

We each wandered until we found this place, a small valley with clean air and a source of fresh water. 

That's how the three of us met.

Lance: Um, hello there. I wasn‘t expecting to meet anyone else here. I‘m Lance.
Lance: I'm an accountant. Well, I used to be. Now… I suppose I don't know what I am now.

Abuela: Encantado! I am Maria, but call me abuela.
Abuela: I used to have a big family. Always someone running around, so much noise! It used to drive me crazy.
Abuela: Now, I miss them a lot.

Stella: Namaste. My name is Stella, like the star. 
Stella: I'm a bit of a free spirit. I've always let the Universe guide me to where I need to go.
Stella: And now I am here.

Lance: This seems like a rather nice little valley.
Stella: Yes! This place has a wonderful energy! I think we should stay here.
Abuela: But there's nowhere to sleep! We have to set up a shelter.
Lance: I'm onboard, but we'll need to find some wood to set up something rudimentary.
Lance: There's not much here except for this single tree.
Stella: I sense the presence of a forest nearby. I can go there to gather some.
Abuela: All by yourself? That's dangerous, mija!
Lance: Let's send two people to find wood. The remaining person can watch the campfire.

SCENE - FOREST

Lance: We actually found a forest!
Stella: You sound surprised. Didn't I tell you it was there?
Lence: Well, you said you "sensed the forest's presence." Pardon me if I don't view that as the most reliable form of directions.
Stella: You should have a little more trust. Mother Nature can guide us wherever we need to go.
Lance: Well, Mother Nature also obliberated Birmingham, so I might have some trust issues.
Lance: Now back to the task at hand. We need some sturdy wood for the shelter.
Lance: We have no axe, so we just have to look for large fallen branches.
Stella: Wonderful. Mother Nature can show us where to find wood.
Lance: Or we could just look for it on the ground, like normal people.

Lance: All right, let's do it your way. Lead the way, Mother Nature.
Stella: Close your eyes and listen to her voice.
Lance: Hmm. I do feel a strange urge to turn left…
Stella: Look! Over there – those branches are usable, right?
Lance: They're perfect! 
Lance: Would you look at that. Mother Nature has led us to success.

SCENE - CAMP

Abuela: Welcome back! Did you find any wood?
Stella: Of course. There's nothing you can't achieve with an open mind and spirit.
Lance: I would argue with that, but doing things Stella's way worked out surprisingly well.
Abuela: How nice. I made soup for everyone. After we've eaten, we can set up the shelter!

title: StellaLance_Mission1Fail

Lance: There are plenty of branches over here.
Stella: Hmm, they look quite brittle to me.
Lance: No, they're – 
Lance: Good grief, you're right. These branches break if you look at them sternly.
Stella: It's getting late. We should head back to camp.
Lance: And return empty-handed?
Stella: What other choice do we have?

Abuela: Welcome back! Did you find any wood?
Lance: Don't ask.
Stella: We would have been fine, if Lance had listened to Mother Nature's voice.
Lance: Well, you should have sensed a better forest then!
Abuela: Don't fight. We'll just have to try again.
Abuela: But maybe another pair can go this time.

SCENE - FOREST

Stella: Here we are in the forest, just like I sensed.
Abuela: Impressive, mija. You are well-attuned to nature.
Stella: I just listen to Mother Nature's voice.
Stella: And look, there are some sturdy branches! Let's collect them.
Abuela: Ah, don't take that many, mija!
Abuela: Women shouldn't carry so much. We are far too delicate.
Stella: That's quite a limiting belief, abuela. Women are a lot stronger than that.
Stella: And we'll need a lot of wood if we want to construct a decent shelter.

Abuela: Oh, who am I to tell you what to do.
Stella: Don't worry, you don't have to carry more than a couple of branches.
Stella: I'll take the rest.

Lance: Welcome back! How did it go?
Abuela: Look at all the wood we gathered! Stella carried most of it.
Stella: Thanks… I - need a rest now.
Lance: Well done. This is perfect building material.
Lance: I made some sandwiches. Once we've eaten, let's set up the shelter!

title: StellaAbuela_Mission1Fail

Stella: Well, I guess we shouldn't take too much from the forest.
Abuela: Very wise, mija. Let's head back.

Lance: Welcome back! How did it go?
Abuela: We found some wood. Here.
Lance: Oh… That's not a lot. We'll need a lot more to construct a shelter.
Stella: See? I told you, abuela.
Lance: Looks like we'll just have to go on another trip to the forest.
Lance: But maybe we should try a different combination of people this time…

SCENE - ROAD

Abuela: Which way could this forest be?
Lance: We don't even know that there is one. Stella only said she "sensed" one.
Abuela: This is a rural area. We'll have to find a forest eventually.
Abuela: I think I hear birdsong from the left path. Let's go this way.
Lance: I don't know. The path to the right looks a bit more well-trodden.

Abuela: We found it! The birds are never wrong.
Lance: Well done, abuela. I'm glad we followed your keen ears.
Lance: There's lots of sturdy branches around. Let's gather them and return to the camp.

Stella: Welcome back! Did you find the forest?
Abuela: Yes, mija. We just had to follow the sound of the birds.
Stella: How wonderful! They are Mother Nature's minstrels.
Lance: Err, sure. More importantly, though, we gathered all the wood that we need.
Stella: Wonderful. I made seed porridge while you were gone. After we've eaten, we can set up the shelter!

Abuela: We've been walking along this road for quite a while. 
Lance: I'm sure we'll hit the forest soon.
Abuela: Really? Because I think we've seen that rock over there before.
Abuela: Are we walking in circles?
Lance: What? No! Um … maybe.
Abuela: We should go back to the camp. Stella will know the way.
Lance: You mean sense it? … Fine.

Abuela: No, mija. We just walked in circles.
Lance: I'm still not convinced the forest exists.
Stella: Oh, it does. I hear it calling us.
Stella: We can try again. But this time, maybe I should come with you…

Abuela: How do we build a shelter? I've never constructed anything in my life.
Stella: Oh, how hard can it be?
Lance: Err, it's not quite that easy.
Lance: But luckily, I know a thing or two about carpentry.
Abuela: Oh, que suerte! I though you were an accountant. Where did you learn that?
Lance: My ex-husband and I bought a house. It was a bit of a fixer-upper.
Lance: We poured our heart and soul into the renovation. It turned out quite nice, if I do say so myself.
Lance: Of course, there's not much left of it now.
Stella: Well then, let's set up this shelter!
Abuela: We're almost out of food, though. One of us should look for nuts and mushrooms, or we'll go hungry tomorrow.

title: StellaLance_Mission2

Lance: All right, first thing we need to do is tie these branches together in a V shape.
Stella: Can't we just cover the branches with clay?
Stella: I once volunteered on a farm where we made clay with horse manure and-
Lance: Stella, I appreciate your… creative approach to problem solving.
Lance: But this will go a lot faster if you just trust me here.
Stella: ...
Stella: Very well. Hand me that rope.

Abuela: I'm not sure I will be much help in this. I'm not very strong.
Lance: Don't worry. If you just hand me that rope, and we'll tie the branches together like so.
Abuela: Amazing! I'm learning so much today.
Abuela: You remind me of my nephew, Diego. He's talented with these things, too. He once built me a rocking chair ...
Abuela: He also likes los hombres. And did I mention he's very handsome?
Lance: Abuela, are you trying to set me up with your nephew?
Abuela: Mijo. All I'm saying is that if Diego ever finds his way to our camp, you two will get along very well.
Lance: Good to know. Let's get back to building the shelter, shall we?

title: StellaAbuela_Mission2

Abuela: I don't know if it was a good idea to do this without Lance.
Abuela: He seemed to know what he's talking about.
Stella: I'm sure we can figure it out without him.
Stella: Maybe we can the branches stick together with clay?
Stella: I once volunteered on a farm where we made clay with horse manure.
Abuela: No caballos here, mija.
Stella: Well, we can just mix some soil with water to make mud.
Abuela: If you think so ...
Stella: Oh no! This isn't sticking a all.
Abuela: All we've made is a mess.
Abuela: Let's start again. But this time, we should really ask Lance to help.

Stella: We did it! We have a shelter.
Abuela: Well done, Lance. We couldn't have done it wiuthout you,
Lance: Oh, it's not much. Give me some time and better tools, and we can make a lot of improvements.
Stella: This is perfect for now, though.
Abuela: Almost feels like home, doesn't it?
Lance: You know, it almost does. It almost does.
